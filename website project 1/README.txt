So this is a website that I created with a group of people. It has two components the app created using React and the server, which connects to a MongoDB database. So the MongoDB database eventually closes, so that might not be functional; however, you can still run the app without the server. What this does is it displays images and descriptions based on what the user puts in. First, the user would have to log in or sign in then they could add, edit, or delete images and descriptions. Unfortunately, these functionalities donâ€™t work without the database being on because that will store user information. However, with the database, it works fine.
Another note that this folder does not have the node module folders because they are too large however it has the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.
